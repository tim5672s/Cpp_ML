## MNIST Dataset
This MNIST database of handwriteen digits, has a training set of 60.000 examples and a test set of 10.000 examples.
It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and 
centered in a fixed-size image.

Four files are available on this site:

- train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:  training set images (9912422 bytes)
- train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:  training set labels (28881 bytes)
- t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:   test set images (1648877 bytes)
- t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:   test set labels (4542 bytes)
